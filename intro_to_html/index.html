        <h1> Gecko Appreciation</h1>
        <p> Hello! If you are reading this webpage, you may share an intrest in geckos like I do! 
            Because this is my first website evermade, I wanted to discuse a topic that was interesting to me.
            What you will find on the webpage will be various topics related to geckos and why I find
            them to be quite neat. For starters on why geckos are neat, I think a majority of them have fascinating  
            appearances. Because geckos come in a wide varaiaty of shapes, sizes, and colors, there are over a thousand
            differant speicies curently discoverd.</p>

        <h2> One Of My Favorite Geckos</h2>
        <p> Haveing over a thousand variants in a species makes it difficult to talk about EVERY gecko ever discoverd and classified.
            With that difficulty in mind I'm just going to share a few noteworthy favorites of mine. The first gecko I would like to 
            talk about is Eublepharis macularius, or more commonly known as the "Leopard gecko." This is a popular lizard among pet owners
            for its distinct yellow body and black spots. Compared to other reptiles, lepard geckos are on the easier side for care, this 
            is the primary reason for their popularity along with appearances.
