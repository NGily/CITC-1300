    <h3>Sticky Toes and More</h3>
    <p> Geckos’ adhesive toes are one of nature’s engineering marvels. 
        Their toes are covered with microscopic hairs called setae, each of which branches out into even smaller structures that interact with surfaces at a molecular level. 
        This allows geckos to scale vertical walls and even hang upside down. Scientists have studied this ability to develop bio-inspired adhesives and climbing robots. 
        The gecko’s foot structure continues to amaze researchers around the world. As you can see, we have learned quite alot from our tiny friends.</p>

    <h3>Incredible Defenses</h3>
    <p> Geckos have some clever ways of avoiding predators. 
        In addition to dropping their tails, they can also blend into their surroundings with camouflaging skin. 
        Some species even make loud hissing or clicking sounds to startle attackers. 
        Their soft, flexible bodies allow them to hide in small crevices where predators can't reach. 
        These adaptive traits make them successful survivors in a variety of ecosystems.
